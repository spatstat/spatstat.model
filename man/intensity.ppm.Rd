  }
  \item{\dots}{
    Arguments passed to \code{\link{predict.ppm}} in some cases.

\details{
  This is a method for the generic function \code{\link[spatstat.geom]{intensity}}
  for fitted point process models (class \code{"ppm"}).

  The intensity of a point process model is the expected
  number of random points per unit area. 

  If \code{X} is a Poisson point process model, the intensity of the
  process is computed exactly.
  The result is a numerical value if \code{X}
  is a stationary Poisson point process, and a pixel image if \code{X}
  is non-stationary. (In the latter case, the resolution of the pixel
  image is controlled by the arguments \code{\dots} which are passed
  to \code{\link{predict.ppm}}.)

  If \code{X} is a Gibbs point process model that is not a Poisson model,
  the intensity is computed approximately:
  \itemize{
    \item if \code{approx="Poisson"} (the default),
    the intensity is computed  using the Poisson-saddlepoint approximation
    (Baddeley and Nair, 2012a, 2012b, 2017; Anderssen et al, 2014).
    This approximation is currently available for pairwise-interaction
    models (Baddeley and Nair, 2012a, 2012b)
    and for the area-interaction model and Geyer saturation model
    (Baddeley and Nair, 2017).

    If the model is non-stationary. the pseudostationary solution
    (Baddeley and Nair, 2012b; Anderssen et al, 2014) is used.
    The result is a pixel image,
    whose resolution is controlled by the arguments \code{\dots}
    which are passed to \code{\link{predict.ppm}}.
    
    The Poisson saddlepoint approximation uses the Lambert W-function
    \code{\link{LambertW}} and runs approximately 100 times faster
    if the suggested package \pkg{gsl} is loaded. 

  \item if \code{approx="DPP"}, the intensity is calculated using
    the approximation of (Coeurjolly and Lavancier, 2018) based on a
    determinantal point process. This approximation is more accurate
    than the Poisson saddlepoint approximation, for inhibitory
    interactions. However the DPP approximation is only available
    for stationary pairwise interaction models.
