    Fixed.

    o anova.mppm
    Results were sometimes incorrect if the two models
    had different interactions (e.g. Strauss vs Poisson).
    Fixed.

    from new.coef'.
    Fixed.

    The function 'eem' is now generic, with methods for 'ppm' and 'slrm'.
    The function previously named 'eem' is now called 'eem.ppm'.

    New arguments 'xlim', 'ylim' determine the range of parameter values
    to be considered.

    o Hybrid
    Printed output from hybrid models has been improved slightly.

    the optimization algorithm should be numerically stabilized.

    o pcf
    Improved error message
    
BUG FIXES

    o kppm
    Results were sometimes incorrect for method='clik2' and method='palm'
    because the log composite likelihood was erroneously truncated to
    positive values. Any fitted model for which logLik(model) = 2.2e-16
    should be suspected of being incorrect.
    Fixed.

    o MultiHard
    A hybrid of 'MultiHard' with another multitype interaction caused an error.
    Fixed.

    o simulate.dppm, simulate.detpointprocfamily
    Crashed, rarely, with error message 'The dimension differs from
    the number of columns in index'.
    Fixed.

    o mppm
    Covariates which are functions may now depend on the marks
    as well as the spatial coordinates: function(x,y,marks).

    o subfits
    The fitted interaction coefficients were garbled.
    If 'mfit' is the mppm object and 'a <- subfits(mfit)[[i]]' is one of the
    sub-models, then coef(a) was correct, but coef(fitin(a)) was incorrect.
    The fitted interaction was shown correctly by printing 'mfit'
    but incorrectly by printing 'a'.
    Fixed.
    
    o varcount
    The result was very inaccurate if the cluster radius was small 
    compared to the size of the window 'B', due to discretisation error.
    Fixed.

    than the correct values) near the edge of the window,
    because an 'edge correction' was mistakenly applied.
    Fixed.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o simulate.kppm
    Conditional simulation of the model, given a fixed number of points,
    is now supported using the new arguments 'n.cond' and 'w.cond'.
    
    o slrm
    In the default case (where dataAtPoints is not given)
    all spatial covariates, including the spatial coordinates x and y,
    are now evaluated at the centre of each pixel. This improves
    consistency with other implementations of spatial logistic regression.

    when the summary function produces NA or NaN or infinite values.
    

BUG FIXES

    o rMatClust, rThomas, rCauchy, rVarGamma
    If the fitted model was effectively a Poisson process,
    the result did not have attributes 'Lambda' and 'parents'
    even when the user requested them.
    Fixed.
    
    o model.matrix.mppm
    Crashed with random-effects models.
    Fixed.

    o anova.mppm
    Crashed with random-effects models.
    Fixed.

    New argument 'rvalue'.

BUG FIXES

    o simulate.kppm
    Simulation results for log-Gaussian Cox processes were incorrect
    unless the pixel dimensions and pixel spacings were identical
    on the horizontal and vertical axes. (If pixel dimensions were not
    specified, then the results were incorrect whenever the Frame of the
    simulation window was not a square.) 
    [Spotted by Tilman Davies.]
    Fixed.
    
    o print.ppm
    Crashed sometimes when applied to the result of subfits().

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.core
    The package 'spatstat.core' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the core functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data. For an overview, see help("spatstat.core-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.core' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
