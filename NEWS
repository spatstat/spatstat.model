    positive values. Any fitted model for which logLik(model) = 2.2e-16
    should be suspected of being incorrect.
    Fixed.

    o MultiHard
    A hybrid of 'MultiHard' with another multitype interaction caused an error.
    Fixed.

    o simulate.dppm, simulate.detpointprocfamily

    o subfits
    The fitted interaction coefficients were garbled.
    If 'mfit' is the mppm object and 'a <- subfits(mfit)[[i]]' is one of the
    sub-models, then coef(a) was correct, but coef(fitin(a)) was incorrect.
    The fitted interaction was shown correctly by printing 'mfit'
    but incorrectly by printing 'a'.
    Fixed.
    
    o varcount
    The result was very inaccurate if the cluster radius was small 
    compared to the size of the window 'B', due to discretisation error.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o ic
    Information criteria for model selection in ppm and kppm.
    Kindly contributed by Achmad Choiruddin, Jean-Francois Coeurjolly
    and Rasmus Waagepetersen.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o simulate.kppm
    Conditional simulation of the model, given a fixed number of points,
    is now supported using the new arguments 'n.cond' and 'w.cond'.
    
    o slrm
    In the default case (where dataAtPoints is not given)
    all spatial covariates, including the spatial coordinates x and y,
    are now evaluated at the centre of each pixel. This improves
    consistency with other implementations of spatial logistic regression.
    
    o slrm
    Silently ignores any arguments '...' that are not recognised by 'as.mask'

    o summary.mppm
    Improved summary of the dependence of the
    interpoint interaction on the covariates.

    o pairs.im
    New argument 'drop'.
    
BUG FIXES

    o model.matrix.mppm
    If the model was fitted using 'gam', the resulting matrix
    did not have an 'assign' attribute.
    Fixed.
    
    o model.depends
    Crashed for models fitted using 'gam'.
    Fixed.

    o predict.slrm, fitted.slrm
    Crashed if the model was fitted using split pixels (argument 'splitby').
    Fixed.

    o predict.slrm, fitted.slrm
    Crashed in some cases when 'window' was given.
    Fixed.

    o update.slrm
    Failed to find covariates that were provided in 'env'.
    Fixed.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 2.0-0

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Corey Anderson, Michael Chirico, Andy Craig,
    Marcelino de la Cruz, Tilman Davies, Pavel Fibich,
    Kurt Hornik, Gopalan Nair, Yonatan Rosen and Rasmus Waagepetersen
    for contributions.
    
    o More support for spatial logistic regression models.

    o predict.mppm now works for multitype point process models.

    o Improved handling of 'newdata' in predict.mppm.

    o More support for multi-dimensional patterns.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o slrm
    'step' can now be applied to models fitted using 'slrm'.

    o predict.mppm
    Now supports multitype point process models.

    o predict.mppm
    Improved handling of argument 'newdata'
    
    o simulate.ppm
    Now recognises the argument 'window' as an alternative to 'w'.

    o kppm
    Improved numerical robustness.

    o anova.mppm
    Issues a warning when applied to random-effects models
    (models fitted using the argument 'random').

    o mincontrast
    New argument 'action.bad.values' specifies what action is taken
    when the summary function produces NA or NaN or infinite values.
    

BUG FIXES

    o rMatClust, rThomas, rCauchy, rVarGamma
    If the fitted model was effectively a Poisson process,
    the result did not have attributes 'Lambda' and 'parents'
    even when the user requested them.
    Fixed.
    
    o model.matrix.mppm
    Crashed with random-effects models.
    Fixed.

    o anova.mppm
    Crashed with random-effects models.
    Fixed.

    o objsurf.kppm
    Crashed if the model was fitted by Palm likelihood (method="palm")
    or second order composite likelihood (method="clik2").
    Fixed.
    
    
        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-11

OVERVIEW

    o Internal tweaks.
    
        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-10

OVERVIEW

    o Minor corrections to documentation.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-9

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Ian Buller for a suggestion.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-8

OVERVIEW

    o Minor changes to appease the compiler.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-7

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Michael Chirico for a contribution.

    o Minor changes to appease the compiler.
    
        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-6

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Tilman Davies and Pavel Fibich for contributions.

    o Important bug fix in simulation of log-Gaussian Cox processes.

    o Increased speed for large datasets.

    o variance calculations handle larger datasets.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o vcov.ppm, summary.ppm
    Variance calculations now handle larger datasets
    (using sparse arrays).
    
    o overall speed
    Changes have been made to the internal code of spatstat 
    which should accelerate computations involving large datasets.

    o localpcf, localpcfinhom
    New argument 'rvalue'.

BUG FIXES

    o simulate.kppm
    Simulation results for log-Gaussian Cox processes were incorrect
    unless the pixel dimensions and pixel spacings were identical
    on the horizontal and vertical axes. (If pixel dimensions were not
    specified, then the results were incorrect whenever the Frame of the
    simulation window was not a square.) 
    [Spotted by Tilman Davies.]
    Fixed.
    
    o print.ppm
    Crashed sometimes when applied to the result of subfits().
    Fixed.
    
    CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-5

OVERVIEW

    o Minor changes required by CRAN.
    

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-1

OVERVIEW

    o Added NEWS file.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.core
    The package 'spatstat.core' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the core functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data. For an overview, see help("spatstat.core-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.core' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
